# School District Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
Initially data from a school district was cleaned, formatted into tables and then analyzed.  Reading and testing scores for students from fifteen schools in a district were combined with budget, school size and school type data.  Tables were created to show the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, the average math and reading scores for students at each grade level, school performance based on budget, school performance based on school size, and school performance based on type of school.  

After the analysis was completed it was discovered that some of the data had been altered prior to being analyzed.  Specifically, the reading and writing scores for the ninth grade students at Thomas High School were suspect.  To remedy this, all ninth grade scores from Thomas High School were removed from the data set and the calculations and tables created were re-created.  The affect this change had on the conclusions drawn about the district, schools as a whole, and Thomas High School are discussed below.
